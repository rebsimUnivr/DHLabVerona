# Make a webpage using GitHub

It's very easy! You just need to:

1. Create an *html* page (I'm not here to teach you how, but you can find one ready [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimoneRebora/GitHubVerona2022/main/docs/pizza_map.html))
2. Rename it as "index.html" and place it in the main folder of your repository
3. After having committed the change, go to "Settings" -> "Pages"
4. In the "Source" panel, you have to select "Branch:main" and then *Save*

A link (generally "your_username.github.io/your_repository") will appear. Just wait a minute, then click on it!
